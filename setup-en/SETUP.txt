TiMidity++ uses Either GUS/patch, or SoundFont(, or both) as the voice
data to play.  You must get a SoundFont or GUS/patch files, and make
the configuration file.  You must make the configuration file (*.cfg).
By default, timidity.cfg is /usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg (or
C:\WINDOWS\TIMIDITY.CFG on Windows).  And please check the following
sites for many voice(patch) data:

Eawpats for TiMidity++
======================================================================

TiMidity doesn't work itself.  TiMidity needs GUS/patch set which is
set of sound patch.  There are no WAVE information in *.mid file, so
TiMidity use GUS/patch to convert MIDI to WAVE file.  Note that this
`patch' means one of the wave sound file in MIDI technical term.

Many GUS/patches are available from the internet.  Some people collect
these patches and make a set of the patch for TiMidity.  I recommend
the patch of Eric A. Welsh <ewelsh@gpc.ibc.wustl.edu>.
